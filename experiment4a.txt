Freedom fighters are people who fought to free their country from an oppressor. They often face hardships in the process of securing the freedom of their country and people. Because of the freedom fighters who fought for Indian independence, we celebrate Independence Day on August 15 every year. People honour them for their love and sacrifice made for their country.
